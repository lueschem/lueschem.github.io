# Introduction

# Chat

_Me:_ How can I change the hostname on a Debian system on the first boot?

---

_ChatGPT:_ One way to change the hostname on a Debian system during the first boot is to use the "preseed"
configuration file. This file can be used to automate the installation process and set various system parameters,
including the hostname.

You can create a preseed file with the desired hostname and include it on the installation media or make it available
over the network. The installer will use the settings in the preseed file during the installation process.

Another way is to use the "hostnamectl" command after the system is booted up. The hostnamectl command can be used
to change the hostname of the system.

```
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname
```

You can also edit the /etc/hostname file and change the hostname in the first line of the file.

```
sudo nano /etc/hostname
```

Then reboot your system for the changes to take effect.

---

_Me:_ How can I automate this using a systemd service?

---

_ChatGPT:_ You can create a systemd service to automatically set the hostname on boot.
First, create a new file in the `/etc/systemd/system` directory called `sethostname.service` with the following
contents:

```
[Unit]
Description=Set Hostname

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/bash -c "echo new_hostname > /etc/hostname; hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make sure to replace "new_hostname" with the desired hostname.

Then, you need to reload the systemd daemon to recognize the new service:

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```
Enable the service to run at boot time:

```
sudo systemctl enable sethostname.service
```

You can check the status of the service with:

```
sudo systemctl status sethostname.service
```

Finally, you need to reboot the system to apply the hostname changes made by the service.

This service will run at boot time and set the hostname of your Debian system to the desired value specified in
the service file.

---

_Me:_ Sure - let me try this!

---

_ChatGPT:_ Sure! I'm glad I could help. Let me know if you have any other questions or run into any issues while
setting up the service.

---

_Me:_ Great - it worked! But now I have a small problem: Whenever I execute a sudo command, I get the following
error: "sudo: unable to resolve host newhostname: Name or service not known"

---

_ChatGPT:_ This error is caused because the hostname is not properly set in the `/etc/hosts` file.
When you set the hostname with the hostnamectl command or the /etc/hostname file, the hostname is only set for
the running system, but it is not set in the `/etc/hosts` file.

To resolve this issue, you need to update the `/etc/hosts` file to include the new hostname.
You can do this by running the following command as root: 

```
echo "127.0.0.1 localhost new_hostname" >> /etc/hosts
```

Make sure to replace "new_hostname" with the hostname you want to set.

You should also include the hostname in the first line of the /etc/hosts file if it's not already there

```
127.0.0.1       localhost new_hostname
```

You can also use the `sed` command to update the /etc/hosts file.

```
sudo sed -i "s/^127.0.0.1.*/127.0.0.1\tlocalhost\t$(hostname)/" /etc/hosts
```

After updating the /etc/hosts file, you may need to log out and log back in or reboot the system for the changes
to take effect.

This should resolve the issue and you should no longer receive the "unable to resolve host" error message when
running sudo command.

---

_Me:_ Perfect - this does the trick! However, I am a bit worried that the above systemd service does kick in a bit
too late.
Can we somehow make sure that the service starts early during bootup?

---

_ChatGPT:_ Yes, it's possible to make sure that the `sethostname.service` starts early during the boot process by
modifying the `WantedBy` parameter in the `sethostname.service` file.

The `WantedBy` parameter in the `[Install]` section of the service file determines when the service should be
started.
By default, it is set to `multi-user.target`, which means that the service will start after the system has reached
the multi-user target state, which is relatively late in the boot process.

If you want to make sure that the service starts earlier in the boot process, you can set the `WantedBy`
parameter to `basic.target` or `sysinit.target`.

`basic.target`: This is the default target when system boots up and most of the basic services are started.

`sysinit.target`: This is the first target that is reached during boot process, and it is responsible for basic
initialization of the system.

So you can change the `WantedBy` parameter in the `sethostname.service` file to `sysinit.target`

```
[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target
```

Then, you need to reload the systemd daemon and enable the service again

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sethostname.service
```

Keep in mind that setting the service to start at `sysinit.target` it will be started before most of the basic
services. So it's important to make sure that the service is not dependent on any other service that may not be
started yet.

Please also note that changing the `WantedBy` parameter to `sysinit.target` may not work in all systems, and it
may have an impact on the boot process, so you should test it before deploying it in a production environment.

---

_Me:_ hostenamectl set-hostname requires udev. I guess that before sysinit.target we do not have udev. How can I
get around this issue?

---

_ChatGPT:_ You are correct that the `hostnamectl set-hostname` command requires udev to be running, and udev is
typically started after the `sysinit.target`.

One way to work around this issue is to use a simple bash script that sets the hostname by directly editing
the `/etc/hostname` file, instead of using the `hostnamectl set-hostname` command.

You can create a script named `set-hostname.sh` with the following contents:

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "new_hostname" > /etc/hostname
```

Make sure to replace "new_hostname" with the desired hostname.

Then, you can modify the `sethostname.service` file to run this script on boot

```
[Unit]
Description=Set Hostname

[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/usr/bin/bash /path/to/set-hostname.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=sysinit.target
```

You can also use the `sed` command in the script to update the /etc/hosts file.

```
#!/bin/bash
echo "new_hostname" > /etc/hostname
sed -i "s/^127.0.0.1.*/127.0.0.1\tlocalhost\t$(hostname)/" /etc/hosts
```

After that, you need to make the script executable by running the following command:

```
sudo chmod +x /path/to/set-hostname.sh
```

Then, you need to reload the systemd daemon, enable the service, and reboot the system to apply the changes

```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable sethostname.service
sudo reboot
```

This way you are not relying on udev to set the hostname and you can set it early on the boot process.
Please keep in mind that this method may have some limitations and you may need to test it before deploying it
in a production environment.
